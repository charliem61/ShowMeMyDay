A storage app for important events in calendar form for the users day based on the hour.

Goal/Motivation:

    When the user approaches the ShowMeMyDay app, they will have the ablility to save important events in calender form for a 24 hr period. These events will have the ablity to be logged individually by the user and added to the calender they can they see, view, and edit.

Problems Solved:

    Adding prompt for user to add an event. Logging that event with event listener. And then recording with console log into the calender. 

The Standout:

    

Challenges Faced:

    My challenge was having the events show up at first. Then to show up correctly displayed onto the calender.
